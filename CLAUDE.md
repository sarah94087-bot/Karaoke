# karaoke — working notes

Hebrew karaoke player. Upload a song, get separated stems, sing over the
backing track with real-time key and tempo control and timed lyrics.

The spec and the task breakdown are in `docs/`. Findings from phase 0 are in
`docs/phase0/` and are referenced by later decisions — read them before
reopening a decision they already settled.

## Where things are

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `apps/{api,web,gpu}` | product code — FastAPI, Next.js, remote GPU functions |
| `packages/{core,audio,lyrics,providers}` | shared domain code |
| `research/` | phase 0 measurement scripts and prototypes — finished, kept to reproduce numbers |
| `docs/phase0/` | findings and verified quotas |
| `infra/{docker,github}` | phase 3 |

`packages/providers` is the seam for every external service. Phase 0 already
forced two provider changes, so keep it thin.

## Commands

Run every check (lint, format, types, tests):

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\check.py
```

`--fix` applies lint fixes and reformats. CI runs this same file.

Run the API (docs at `/docs`, health at `/system/health`):

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Serve the prototypes locally:

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Deploy / measure the GPU function:

```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m modal deploy apps\gpu\karuki_modal.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe apps\gpu\run_remote.py measure 5
```

Note: `modal deploy` reports "no changes detected" even after edits. Bump
`BUILD` in `karuki_modal.py` to force it.

## Environment quirks that cost time before

- PowerShell 5.1 has no `&&`. Use `;` or separate commands.
- This machine runs TLS inspection. `requests` fails with "self-signed
  certificate in certificate chain" — `research/verify_groq.py` fixes it with
  `truststore.inject_into_ssl()`, not by disabling verification. `curl` needs
  `--ssl-no-revoke`.
- Console is cp1255. Set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` when a tool prints Unicode,
  and pass `encoding="utf-8"` to `subprocess` when filenames are Hebrew.

## Rules that come from the spec, not from preference

- **No credit card on any service.** Chapter 1 is explicit: without a card the
  worst case is a pause, with one it is a surprise bill. Cloudflare R2 was
  rejected on these grounds even though its free tier fits.
- Published free-tier numbers are unreliable. Two of three were wrong in the
  project's disfavour. Verify in the account, which is what `T-0.6` is for.
- The Supabase project configured in the environment is **not ours**. Do not
  connect to it.

## Status

Phase 0 closed: 19 of 21 tasks done, one cancelled, one blocked on hardware
(`T-0.2.5`, the phone test — everything for it is built and waiting).

Phase 1 in progress. `T-1.1` and `T-1.2` done. Next is `T-1.3`: Postgres in
Docker Compose, one command bringing up API + DB.

From `T-1.2`, worth knowing before touching `apps/api`:

- `/system/health` is registered twice — documented at `/api/v1/system/health`,
  and unlisted at `/system/health` for the container healthcheck and the
  keep-alive cron, so those are configured once and survive a prefix change.
  It must stay cheap: no DB, no storage, no outbound call. A test asserts it.
- Every response carries `request_id`, echoed as `X-Request-ID`. The 500 case is
  handled in `apps/api/middleware.py`, not by an app-level handler, because an
  app-level handler runs outside the middleware and would emit the one response
  with no id on it.
- Errors are `{"error": {"code", "message"}, "request_id"}`. `code` is what the
  web app maps to Hebrew text.
- Dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies]`
  but not installed from there — the venv was built by hand in phase 0. The
  `api` group is what the `T-1.3` Dockerfile should install.

Open provider decisions, both deferred to phase 3 and neither blocking:
`D-12` storage (needs an alternative to R2) and `D-15`/`D-16` database and auth.
